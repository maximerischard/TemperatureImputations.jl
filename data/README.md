> Time of observations for many Cooperative observing network Tmax and Tmin readings are listed according to this layout are listed on [this website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/homr/reports) under the 'PUBLICATION HISTORY REPORT' heading.  

The website has this description:

> The Historical Observing Metadata Repository (HOMR) is NCEI's integrated station history database that provides in situ or land-based station metadata in support of NCEI research, reporting, data products, and web applications. HOMR tracks detailed information for a variety of weather stations throughout their lifespans, including identifiers, names, locations, **observation times**, reporting methods, photos, and equipment modifications and siting. Station histories are most extensive for the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observing Program, and they include officially documented station changes that adhere to an NWS approval process.
