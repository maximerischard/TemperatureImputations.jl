    "\n",
    "In the paper presenting the temperature imputations approach to the hour of measurement bias, we demonstrated our ability to “recover” summary statistics such as the average maximum temperature.\n",
    "We focused on statistics such as the average daily maximum temperature, that are deterministic functions of the daily extrema, which are in turn functions of the true temperatures and hour of measurement.\n",
    "To formalize this a little bit, let $\\T_\\miss$ be the time series of temperatures at the location of interest, and $\\hour$ be the hour of measurement.\n",
    "Then we can write the daily temperature extrema as functions $\\Tn\\del{\\T_\\miss, \\hour}$ and $\\Tx\\del{\\T_\\miss, \\hour}$.\n",
    "We additionally used information from temperature time series at nearby airport, which we denote $\\T_\\obs$.\n",
    "The paper shows how to draw imputations of $\\T_\\miss$ from its posterior distribution $\\T_\\miss \\mid \\Tn, \\Tx, \\T_\\obs, \\hour$.\n",
    "The summary statistics of interest are of the form $h\\del{\\Tn, \\Tx}$, which we can expand to $h\\del{\\Tn\\del{\\T_\\miss, \\hour}, \\Tx\\del{\\T_\\miss, \\hour}}$.\n",
    "Therefore the value of the summary statistic indirectly depends on the hour of measurement.\n",
    "In the paper, we show we can infer reasonably well what the statistic *would have been*, had we made the measurements at a different time $\\hour'$.\n",
    "That is, we successfully obtain samples from the posterior distribution\n",
